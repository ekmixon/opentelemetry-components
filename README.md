## Purpose

This repository hosts components that may be imported into distributions of the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector).

## Upstream Components

Several components are included from the OpenTelemetry Collector and its Contrib variant. These are primarily included to facilitate development and testing of new components:

## Development

This project is primarily focused on the development and hosting of new components. As a matter of developer convenience, the project itself is structured as a distribution of the collector. This means that it can easily be built into an executable that can run in the same manner as the collector. 

### Initial Setup

Clone this repository, and run `make install-tools`.

### Tooling

Typical functionality is included, such as `make build` and `make test`. Check out the [Makefile](./Makefile) for additional tooling.
