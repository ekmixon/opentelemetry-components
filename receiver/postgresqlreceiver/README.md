# PostgreSQL Receiver

This receiver queries the PostgreSQL [statistics collector](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/monitoring-stats.html).

> :construction: This receiver is in **BETA**. Configuration fields and metric data model are subject to change.

## Prerequisites

## Configuration

The following settings are required to create a database connection:

The following settings are optional:
